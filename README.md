# Arithmetic_Logic_Unit_Design_Using_HDL

# Credit to Cole Fowler and Fernando Lorenzo for help on this project
This is an ALU design by me and two of my classmates in an effort to learn HDL, these files are compatible with intel quartus ii.

This ALU is an 8 bit ALU, that supports:

	ADD
	SUB	
	MUL
	OR - bitwise
	NOT - bitwise
	AND - bitwise
	XOR - bitwise
	SLL
	SLR
	LESS â€“ is less then bool operation.

Included in the subcontinent folder is a RAM module, also constructed by us along the way.
